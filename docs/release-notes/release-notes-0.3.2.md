How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running version release_v0.3.1 and before, you should shut it down and wait until
 it has completely closed, then just copy over `did` (on Linux).

However, as usual, config, keystore and chaindata files are compatible.

Compatibility
==============

Elastos.ELA.SideChain.ID is supported and extensively tested on operating systems
using the Linux kernel. It is not recommended to use Elastos.ELA.SideChain.ID on
unsupported systems.

Elastos.ELA.SideChain.ID should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
as frequently tested on them.

As previously-supported CPU platforms, this release's pre-compiled
distribution provides binaries for the x86_64 platform.
